* This is a shell to call as short script to exercise (test) the
* basic functionality of the contouring library and, by implication.
* all the underlying libs (math_ext etc.)  as well.  It is not
* intended as a thorough test of the contour-threading routine.
* Note also that this initial version supports only the grid-based
* contouring routines.
